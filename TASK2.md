# Task 2
- Create a Next.js web application that connects to an AWS DynamoDB table and displays the items in the table on a web page.
  
* ### Steps: 
    1. Set up your Next.js project:
           - Create a new Next.js project using the command line or your preferred IDE.
           - Install the AWS SDK for JavaScript package: <code>npm install aws-sdk </code>
           - Import the DynamoDB client from the AWS SDK in your project.           
    2. Connect to the DynamoDB table:
          - Create a new instance of the DynamoDB client with your AWS credentials and the correct region.
          - Use the scan method to retrieve all items in the table.
          - Store the items in an array. 
    3. Display the items on a web page:
          - Create a new page in your Next.js project.
          - Use the getServerSideProps function to retrieve the items from the DynamoDB table and pass them as props to the page component.
          - Map through the items array in the component and display them on the page. 
    4. Test your application:
          - Run your Next.js project and navigate to the page you created.
          - Verify that the items in the DynamoDB table are displayed correctly on the page.
