# Task 3
- Create a Next.js app that uses AWS DynamoDB to store and display a list of products.
- Follow these steps:
    1. Set up an AWS account and create a DynamoDB table to store product data. You can use the AWS console to create the table and define the required attributes.
    2. Create a Next.js app using the create-next-app command. You can use any other preferred method to create a Next.js app.
    3. Install the AWS SDK for JavaScript in your Next.js app. You can use the following command to install it: <code>npm install aws-sdk</code>
    4. Create a pages/index.js file in your Next.js app. This file will contain the code to fetch and display the product data from DynamoDB.
    5. In the pages/index.js file, import the AWS SDK and create a DynamoDB client using your AWS credentials:
    6. Define a function to fetch the product data from DynamoDB using the scan method:
    7. In the pages/index.js file, define a Next.js functional component that will render the product data:
    8. Run your Next.js app using the npm run dev command and check if the product data is being displayed correctly. You can also use the AWS console to add, modify, or delete product data from the DynamoDB table and see the changes reflected in your Next.js app.
- ### ðŸ““ This is just a basic example to get started with Next.js and DynamoDB. You can customize the code according to your specific requirements and add more functionality to your app.
